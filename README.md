Google_Image_Search
===================
Create a google image iOS App

Create a single page app that replicates a basic google image search.  There should be a text field that accepts a search parameter and a way to display images from the resulting query.  You can be creative with the display interface as time allows.  If you want to only display 1 image, that is fine. If you want to create an animated image browser that uses the accelerometer to navigate or something crazy like that, go for it.  The link below is a starter project that queries the Google API and displays the URL for the first image.  You can feel free to use this, or start from scratch.  Your project only needs to run in the simulator.
